# `babel-html`

Usage: `babel-html src-dir dest-dir`

This will compile all scripts embedded in all .html files in `src-dir` and save the results to `dest-dir`

## TODOs

- writing doesn't work at all yet
- the only way to specify config is via `.babelrc` - add command line options
- paths must be directories, not single files - make cmd line more flexible
- write tests
